Midterm Project
================

### Setup

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)
library(wordcountaddin)
```

### Data Cleaning

``` r
accel_data = read_csv(file = "data/p8105_mtp_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(day = as.factor(day)) %>% 
  mutate(day = 
           factor(day, levels = 
                    c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", 
                      "Wednesday", "Thursday",
                      "Friday", "Saturday"), 
                  ordered = TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(day) %>% 
  arrange(week) %>% 
  mutate(total_act = rowSums(.[,3:1440], na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(avg_act = rowMeans(.[,3:1440], na.rm = TRUE))
```

This dataset consists of week, day, and activity variables. Each activity column represents a summary of the voltage signal in a minute of the day. There are 329 rows and 1,442 variables total.

``` r
year_plot = ggplot(accel_data, aes(x = week, y = total_act)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
year_plot
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

```

  filter(week == 30) %>% 
  mutate(daily_act = str_replace(daily_act, "activity_", "")) %>%
